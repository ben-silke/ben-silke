# ðŸ”­ About Me:
I am currently a Senior Full-Stack Software Developer at Aristotle Cloud Services working with Django, Python and Vue.
I have graduated from a Bacherlor of Laws (Honours) and a Bachelor of Science (Honours) with First Class Honours at the Australian National University, where I worked in the Williams lab and investigated engineering resistance to disease in plants.

I am also working on various bioinformatic projects! I am interested in evolution, mutation, cell regulation and protein synthesis.
I like transcriptomics and spatial-omics and would love to work in split bioinformatic and wet-lab focused biology.
Recently, I have begun looking into protein structure prediction, specifically, de novo prediction.

I have a high level of fluency in Python, R, Bash and Javascript; I am also currently learning Rust.
I am open to collaborate on any bioinformatics-related projects.

I also am passionate about development to use machine learning or other technologies to augment and assist the legal process and improve outcomes for participants of the legal system.
