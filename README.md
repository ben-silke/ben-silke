# 🔭 About Me:
I am currently a Senior Full-Stack Software Developer at Aristotle Cloud Services working with Django, Python and Vue.
I am also undertaking my honours year at the Australian National University in the Williams lab looking at engineering resistance to disease in plants using new technologies.

I am also working on various bioinformatic projects! I am interested in evolution, mutation, cell regulation and protein synthesis.
I like transcriptomics and spatial-omics and would love to work in split bioinformatic and wet-lab focused biology.
Recently, I have begun looking into protein structure prediction, specifically, de novo prediction.

I have a high level of fluency in Python, R, Bash and Javascript, and I am currently learning Rust.
I am open to collaborate on any bioinformatics-related projects.

I also currently study a Bachelor of Laws and I am excited about developing methods, using machine learning or otherwise to augment and assist the legal process.
