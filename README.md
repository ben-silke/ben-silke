# ðŸ”­ About Me:
I am currently a Senior Full-Stack Software Developer at Aristotle Cloud Services working with Django, Python and Vue.

I am also working on various bioinformatic projects! I am interested in evolution, mutation, cell regulation and protein synthesis.
I am also interested in transcriptomics and spatial-omics. I am also interested in split bioinformatic and wet lab focused biology.

I am very familiar with Python, R, Bash and Javascript, and I am currently learning Rust.
I am open to collaborate on any bioinformatics related projects.

I also currently study a bachelor of laws and am excited about developing methods, using machine learning or otherwise to augment and assist the legal process.
